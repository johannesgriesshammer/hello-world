# hello-world
My first GitHub repository. The standard thing with hello world.

You want to know some things about me? I am working as frontend developer at an agency in upper franconia, doing WordPress most of the time. The thing I love most is to learn new things, there are so many cool things out there.

A whole new world to explore, with features added every month.
